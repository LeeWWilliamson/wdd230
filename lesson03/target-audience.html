		<h2>Target Audience</h2>
		<p>This site is aimed at those who are seeking to do business in or with the city of Bothell, and may be looking for resources that will help them in their endeavors.  This may include local residents who are looking to start a new business or expand an existing one in the area.  The site may also attract those who have business interests outside of Bothell, but are looking for a city that has good support for expanding in or moving to Bothell with a business.

		<h2>Persona: Business Owner</h2>
		<p>Roger Kimball is a small business owner, with an office in the rural town of Snohomish.  He has planned to expand his business and wants to start by first relocating his office to a more suburban area.  Once established, he wants to set that office up as a central hub for future satellite offices, and extend his service throughout the greater Seattle area.  Bothell is geographically strategic for this, and the Chamber of Commerce can offer good support for setting up his business there.  The Bothell Chamber of Commerce can make data available on other area businesses in the network, and can help him find a wide variety of information on real estate, laws, taxes, and city codes that might relate to his business or the potential office location in Bothell.

		<h2>Persona: Community Volunteer</h2>
		<p>Jennifer Adams is the Parent Teacher Student Association (PTSA) chair for fundraising, in the NorthShore School District.  She is organizing a fundraising auction event, the proceeds of which will be used to purchase backpacks and other needed school supplies for students from financially-challenged families, before school starts.  With the help of the Bothell Chamber of Commerce, she will look for sponsors from local businesses that are willing to support the schools in this way, by donating goods and services as items for auction.  She will also look for a business to donate the use of a suitable venue for the auction itself (hotel, restaurant, or other business that has sufficient meeting space for the event.) This will be good both for the students, and for the businesses that get involved in their community this way.
